###Compiling The Source
IMPORTANT: Make sure you know what you are doing, I am not responsible for anything that happens to your computer while doing this!

1. First of all you need to make sure you have an clean mcp setup with [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) 9.11.1.965+ installed for minecraft 1.6.4. 
2. Make sure you have the [java jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) installed on your computer.
3. Also Make sure you have [apache ant](http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html) installed on your computer. (just search for tutorials on google)
4. Create a empty directory with 2 folders, 1 folder should be called mcp (your mcp should be installed here) and another called source.
5. Download every file in this repo and place them in the folder called source.
6. Make sure you now have a folder with 2 folders. 1 called mcp, this one contains your mcp stuff. The other one called source with every file of this repo (so, in that folder should be another folder called source and some other files).
7. Optionally you can click on the build.proporties and edit the release mod version and the release minecraft version.
8. To create the mod press release.bat.
9. Wait a bit (I mostly need to wait about 20 seconds, but that depends on your computer speed).
10. A folder called releases is now created, in it you will find the created mod file.
